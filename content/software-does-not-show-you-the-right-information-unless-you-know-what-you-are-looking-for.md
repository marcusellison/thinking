title: Software does not show you the right information unless you know what you're looking for
---

- When you type in a search box, you need to remember the name of the thing you're looking for. On the surface it seems reasonable to assume that someone would know what they're looking for, but our brains don't operate the way computers do - with perfect recall.
- Words can often be on the tip of the tongue. And even besides this, optimal working states depend on the human brain not thinking about too many different ideas at the same time.
- This is one reason why [[Effective knowledge software allows the reader to come across the most relevant information, even if the composer or recipients forget about it]]
