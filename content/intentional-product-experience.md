title: Intentional product experience
---

I think of an intentional product experience as one in which the participants feel they created it but was actually designed.

These experiences are common in the physical world but rare in software. One example is graduating from college. The feeling one gets is built over many years and culminates with getting a degree. The experiences the student has on their college journey feels to the student as if she created them when they are actually mapped and intended by the university environment.

Lots of software these days is, unfortunately, rather unintentional. As technology permeates more aspects of our lives, this is unforgivable.

It is no longer adequate to build software that works but leave the participant experience to chance.

Intentional Design is an emerging discipline to solve software's gap in solving problems for humans.
