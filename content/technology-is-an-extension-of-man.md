title: Technology is an extension of man
---

- Since technology is an extension of man, any new technology changes the balance of needs satisfied in relation to the old technology. The collection of technologies required to solve fundamental needs shifts.
- For example, prior to social media, our social needs were satisfied through our bodies. As we social platforms, the new structure of the medium creates need deficits.
  - The replacement is meeting someone in a chat message of in person instead of meeting someone in real life.
  - The ideal experience is in person, technology is only ever a poor substitute, idiotically designed.
  - This is one why truth comes from the ideal experience of the fundamental need - not other solutions.
