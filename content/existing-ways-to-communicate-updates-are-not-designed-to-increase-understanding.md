title: Existing ways to communicate updates are not designed to increase understanding
---

- Most updates are useful only if you understand their context
  - Atomic updates solve this problem by containing the context within the update.
- Updates are difficult to refer back to; they get lost in communication mediums or stored in ways that make finding the most relevant information time-consuming.
  - Atomic updates solve this problem by organizing notes by relevance when they are created.
- Updates are difficult to compare
- Updates are not browsable
- Updates are not organized for action
- As a result of the problems with updates, they fail to do their fundamental job: communicate effectively.
