title: atomic updates

An atomic update is a unit of progress.

The most useful update is [[Atomic]] in the same way that [[Evergreen Notes]] are the most useful kind of note; they both allow us to build on previous knowledge.

[[Existing ways to communicate updates are not designed to increase understanding]].

The heart of this problem is that [[software does not show you the right information unless you know what you are looking for]]

The **solution** is to create a bite-sized, standard update format because

[[standardization enables automatic organization]] which makes updates comparable.

Qualities of an atomic update:

- [[Browsable]]
- [[Comparable]]
- [[Combinable]]
- [[Contextual]]
