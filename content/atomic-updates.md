An atomic update is a unit of progress.

The most useful update is [[Atomic]] in the same way that [[Evergreen Notes]] are the most useful kind of note; they both allow us to build on previous knowledge.

[[Existing ways to communicate updates are not designed to increase understanding]]

The atomic update solves this by comparing and combining updates with context. This leads to deeper understanding of progress.

Qualities of an atomic update:

- [[Browsable]]
- [[Comparable]]
- [[Combinable]]
- [[Contextual]]
