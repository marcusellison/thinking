title: What I'm thinking about

One of the most important obstacles to [[accelerate innovation]] is capturing it effectively.

Some investors talk about this problem as information overload - it's difficult to for them to get through their inbox. Others mention the amount of work required to keep track of data signals from the companies they invest in and store it in a digestible format. Still others point out that for these reasons and more the system itself is flawed; investors are not as efficient at allocating capital as they should be. Promising makers, inventors, and builders - those objectively deserving of investment - often fail to receive it.

I view this problem as one that can partially be solved by technology through better tools to capture progress.

My current hypothesis is that [[atomic updates]] are the best way to capture progress.

[Venturemark](https://venturemark.co/) is an experimental platform for creating these atomic updates.
