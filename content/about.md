I'm thinking about how capturing progress can [[accelerate innovation]].

My current hypothesis is that [[atomic updates]] are the best way to capture units of progress because they are [[comparable]], [[combinable]], and [[contextual]].

[Venturemark](https://venturemark.co/) is an experimental platform for creating atomic updates.
