title: What I'm thinking about

One of the most important obstacles to [[accelerate innovation]] is capturing it effectively.

Some investors describe this problem as information overload or keeping track of signal from the companies they invest in

I view this problem as one that can partially be solved by technology through better tools to capture progress.

My current hypothesis is that [[atomic updates]] are the best way to capture progress because they enable update standardization.

[Venturemark](https://venturemark.co/) is an experimental platform for creating these atomic updates.
