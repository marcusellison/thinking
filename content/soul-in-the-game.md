'Soul in the Game' describes entrepreneurs that build ventures for more than money or fame.

From Nassim Taleb -

> and then you have a category of people, the saints, who give more than they take, and because they feel it is their mission to do that. Like, people who die for the sake of a collective. Revolutionaries, saints, Joan of Arc, and people like that. That’s their mission, and they feel that’s their sense of honor. There’s something about them that makes them derive … In other words, they don’t care about … They’re selfless, and of course, they take risks for the collective, for the improvement of life on Earth.

> And now these people are very, very rare, and you would expect to see them in among people who claim to be a revolutionary. It’s not true. You don’t find them there.
